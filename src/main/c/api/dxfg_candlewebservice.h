/** @defgroup CandleWebService CandleWebService
 *  @brief The client of the history (candle web) service: a request of the time series events of a symbol within a
 *  time range over HTTP, configured with a builder.
 *
 *  dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_newBuilder() creates a builder, the functions dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_Builder_withAddress(),
 *  dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_Builder_withUserName() and the other `dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_Builder_with*` functions set its
 *  parameters and dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_Builder_build() creates the endpoint, which dxfg_HistoryEndpoint_getTimeSeries()
 *  uses to request the events.
 *
 *  A handle that a function returns is owned by the caller: release it with dxfg_JavaObjectHandler_release() (see the
 *  group Javac for the ownership rules). All the functions of this group return #DXFG_EXECUTE_SUCCESSFULLY (0) or
 *  #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL (-1) on error, and the result is passed through an `[out]` parameter; it is not changed on
 *  error. A NULL `[out]` pointer is an error too. dxfg_get_and_clear_thread_exception_t() gives the exception.
