/** @defgroup OnDemand OnDemand
 *  @brief The control of the on-demand historical tick data replay of an endpoint: start, pause, change the speed and
 *  stop the replay, and query its state.
 *
 *  The service is used to switch a feed from the ordinary real-time or delayed data to the replay of the tick-by-tick
 *  history of the market data without any change in the code that consumes the events. The replay works only when
 *  the endpoint is connected to an on-demand data provider (an address with the "(ondemand:<address>)" component, see
 *  dxfg_DXEndpoint_connect()) and the appropriate credentials are provided.
 *
 *  A handle that a function returns is owned by the caller: release it with dxfg_JavaObjectHandler_release() (see the
 *  group Javac for the ownership rules). A function that returns `int32_t` status returns #DXFG_EXECUTE_SUCCESSFULLY
 *  (0) or #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL (-1) on error, a function that returns a pointer returns NULL on error, and a function
 *  that returns a value gives the value that is stated in its `@return` on error. The exception is available from
 *  dxfg_get_and_clear_thread_exception_t().
