/**
 *  @defgroup Feed Feed
 *  @brief The feed (Java `DXFeed`), its subscriptions, the requests of events, and the promises that the requests
 *  return.
 *
 *  The ownership rules of the handles, the strings and the lists are described in the group @ref Javac. The events that
 *  a function returns are released with dxfg_EventType_release(), the lists of events with
 *  dxfg_CList_EventType_release().
 *
 *  In this header a function that returns an `int32_t` status returns #DXFG_EXECUTE_SUCCESSFULLY (0) or
 *  #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL (-1) on error, and a function that returns a pointer returns NULL on error, except
 *  dxfg_Promise_getException() that returns `(dxfg_exception_t *)-1`. The functions that tell the state of a promise
 *  return 1, 0 or -1 on error.
 *
 *  A promise is the result of a request that completes later. The functions that start a request return a handle of the
 *  promise: wait for it (dxfg_Promise_await2()) or add a handler (dxfg_Promise_whenDone()), then read the result
 *  (dxfg_Promise_EventType_getResult(), dxfg_Promise_List_EventType_getResult()) and release the handle.
