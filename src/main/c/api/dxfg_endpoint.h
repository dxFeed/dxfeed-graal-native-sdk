/** @defgroup Endpoint Endpoint
 *  @brief The endpoint (Java `DXEndpoint`): a connection to a data feed or to a publisher, its role and state, and
 *  the access to its feed and publisher.
 *
 *  The ownership rules of the handles, the strings and the lists are described in the group @ref Javac.
 *
 *  A typical life cycle of an endpoint:
 *  1. Create it with dxfg_DXEndpoint_Builder_build() (see the group @ref Builder), dxfg_DXEndpoint_create() or
 *     dxfg_DXEndpoint_create2(). The default endpoint of the process is returned by dxfg_DXEndpoint_getInstance().
 *  2. Optionally add a state change listener (dxfg_PropertyChangeListener_new(),
 *     dxfg_DXEndpoint_addStateChangeListener()) and set the credentials (dxfg_DXEndpoint_user(),
 *     dxfg_DXEndpoint_password()).
 *  3. Connect with dxfg_DXEndpoint_connect() and take the feed (dxfg_DXEndpoint_getFeed()) or the publisher
 *     (dxfg_DXEndpoint_getPublisher()).
 *  4. Close it with dxfg_DXEndpoint_close() or dxfg_DXEndpoint_closeAndAwaitTermination() and release all the
 *     handles with dxfg_JavaObjectHandler_release(). Releasing a handle does not close the endpoint. An endpoint that
 *     stays open keeps its threads running: close all of them with dxfg_system_close_all_and_await_termination()
 *     before graal_tear_down_isolate().
