/** @defgroup Subscription Subscription
 *  @brief Subscriptions to the events of a feed: the event types and the symbols, the listeners of events and of
 *  the changes of the subscription, the executor, the aggregation period and the batch limit.
 *
 *  A subscription (dxfg_subscription_t) is interested in the events whose type is in its set of event types and whose
 *  symbol is in its set of symbols. The event types are set when the subscription is created, the symbols can be
 *  changed at any time. A subscription created by dxfg_DXFeedSubscription_new() or
 *  dxfg_DXFeedSubscription_new2() is detached: it is not attached to any feed and receives no events. Attach it
 *  with dxfg_DXFeedSubscription_attach(). A subscription created by a feed (e.g. dxfg_DXFeed_createSubscription())
 *  is attached to that feed. A time series subscription (dxfg_time_series_subscription_t) is a subscription for
 *  the time series events that is created by a feed with dxfg_DXFeed_createTimeSeriesSubscription().
 *
 *  The events are passed to the event listeners (see dxfg_DXFeedEventListener_new()) by the executor of the
 *  subscription, one batch after another. Add the event listeners before the symbols: the listeners receive the
 *  last events of the symbols that were added. The changes of the subscription are passed to the change listeners
 *  (see dxfg_ObservableSubscriptionChangeListener_new()).
 *
 *  A subscription is closed only by dxfg_DXFeedSubscription_close(): releasing its handle does not close it. A
 *  subscription that stays attached to a feed keeps receiving events and is not freed, so close it when it is not
 *  needed any more.
 *
 *  The ownership rules (handles, strings, lists) are the ones of the group @ref Javac. A symbol or a list that is
 *  passed to a function is only read by the SDK: the caller keeps its ownership. A list that a function returns is
 *  released by the caller with the function given in the description of the function. The value that a function
 *  returns on error is given in its `@return`. dxfg_get_and_clear_thread_exception_t() gives the exception.
