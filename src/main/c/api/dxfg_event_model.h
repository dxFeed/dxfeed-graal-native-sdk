 *
 * After the last handle of the listener is released (dxfg_JavaObjectHandler_release()), the function is not called
 * anymore and none of its calls is in progress, so the user data can be freed.
 *
 * Java: `TxModelListener.eventsReceived(IndexedEventSource, List, boolean)`.
 *
 * @param[in] thread The current GraalVM Isolate's thread.
 * @param[in] function_eventsReceived The function to call when transactions are received; see
 * #dxfg_TxModelListener_function_eventsReceived for the thread and the ownership of its data.
 * @param[in] user_data The pointer that is passed to the function as is; the SDK does not use it. It has to stay valid
 * until the listener is released.
 * @return The listener (release it with dxfg_JavaObjectHandler_release()), or NULL on error. Use
 * dxfg_get_and_clear_thread_exception_t() to get the exception.
