 *
 * Releasing the last handle of the listener with dxfg_v4_JavaObjectHandler_release() (or
 * dxfg_v4_NativeListener_deactivate()) stops the calls of the function: after the release returns the function is not
 * running and is not called anymore, so the user data can be freed. An installed listener cannot be replaced or removed
 * (see dxfg_v4_logging_set_listener()), it can only be deactivated this way.
 *
 * Java: `InterceptableLoggingListener.onLog(Level, long, String, long, String, String, Throwable, String)`.
 *
 * @param[in] thread The current GraalVM Isolate's thread.
 * @param[in] user_func The listener callback.
 * @param[in] user_data The user data that will be passed to the callback; the SDK does not use it. It must stay valid
 * until the listener is deactivated.
 * @param[out] listener The pointer to the variable that receives the new listener (release its handle with
 * dxfg_v4_JavaObjectHandler_release()). It is written only on success. A NULL pointer is an error.
 * @return #DXFG_EXECUTE_SUCCESSFULLY (0) on successful function execution or #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL (-1) on error. Use
 * dxfg_v4_get_and_clear_thread_exception() to determine if an exception was thrown.
