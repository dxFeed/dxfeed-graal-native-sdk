 * @brief The exception that a failed function of the C API leaves for the calling thread.
 *
 * A function of the C API that fails returns an error value (it is given in the `@return` of each function, see
 * dxfg_common.h for #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL) and stores the Java exception that caused the failure for the thread that
 * called it. dxfg_get_and_clear_thread_exception_t() returns the stored exception as a dxfg_exception_t, and
 * dxfg_Exception_release() releases it.

/**
 * @brief Returns the exception of the last failed function call of the calling thread and clears it.

 * Call it when a function reported an error (see the `@return` of that function) to learn what went wrong. The
 * exception is stored per thread: this function returns the exception of the thread that calls it (the `thread`
 * parameter is not used to choose it), so call it on the thread on which the function failed. The stored exception is
 * cleared by this call: a second call returns NULL until another function fails.
 *
 * A function that completes successfully does not clear the stored exception, so call this function right after the
 * error: otherwise it can return the exception of an earlier failure that was not taken. When several functions fail
 * on a thread before the exception is taken, only the exception of the last failure is returned.
 *
 * Java: `JNIThreadLocalPendingException.get()` and `JNIThreadLocalPendingException.clear()` (GraalVM native image),
 * the result is converted from `Throwable`.
 *
 * @param[in] thread The current GraalVM Isolate's thread.
 * @return The exception (release it with dxfg_Exception_release()), or NULL if no exception is stored for the
