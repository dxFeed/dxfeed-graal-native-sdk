/** @defgroup V4_Conventions The v4 functions
 *  @brief The `dxfg_v4_` functions: the operations of the older functions of the C API in one uniform form.
 *
 *  A function of the C API that has a `dxfg_v4_` twin is deprecated in favour of it. The twin is declared in a
 *  `dxfg_v4_<area>.h` header next to the header of the older function (dxfg_v4_api.h and dxfg_api.h include all of
 *  them). dxfg_free_strings() and dxfg_free_string_to_double_map_entries() have no twin and are deprecated: the v4
 *  functions return lists, released by their `dxfg_v4_<element>_list_release()` functions. A twin does the same as
 *  the older function, only its form differs:
 *  - It returns `int32_t`: #DXFG_EXECUTE_SUCCESSFULLY (0) on success, #DXFG_EXECUTE_FAIL (-1) on error. The status is
 *    the only error signal: after -1, dxfg_v4_get_and_clear_thread_exception() gives the exception. A successful call
 *    does not clear an exception left by an earlier failed call that was not taken, so take it right after the error.
 *  - It writes its result to the last parameter, marked #DXFG_OUT: the caller passes the address of its own variable.
 *    The variable is written only if the function succeeds (dxfg_v4_DXFeed_getLastEvent() and
 *    dxfg_v4_DXFeed_getLastEvents() write NULL on error, as their older functions do); after an error its value must
 *    not be used. A NULL out pointer is an error (`IllegalArgumentException`), unless the parameter is documented as
 *    optional.
 *  - A NULL handle, string or list written to the out variable means "no value" (e.g. no session is found), it is
 *    never an error. A number is written as it is: -1 or 0 are ordinary values, not error markers.
 *  - It returns a collection as a list `dxfg_v4_<element>_list` (`size` and `elements`; `elements` of an empty list
 *    may be NULL), which is released with its `dxfg_v4_<element>_list_release()` function. A list that the caller
 *    builds and passes to a function stays the caller's: it is never passed to a release function.
 *  - Its name has no digit suffix: an overload is named by what it takes (e.g. dxfg_v4_TimePeriod_valueOfString()).
 *  - The types of its parameters have `dxfg_v4_` names: typedefs of the older types with the same layout. The
 *    constants of the enumerations keep their names.
 *
 *  The `dxfg_v4_` prefix names a generation of the C API, not a release of the SDK: the rules above hold for every
 *  function and type with this prefix, and later releases, major ones included, add functions with the same prefix.
 *  A new generation appears only when these rules change. It is named after the major release in which it becomes
 *  the only one: the v4 functions become the only ones in 4.0.0.
 *
 *  The older and the v4 functions can be mixed on the same objects: a handle, a string or a list that one of them
 *  returned can be passed to the other one and released by the release function of either.
 *
 *  The older functions that have twins are marked with `DXFG_DEPRECATED`, so the compilers warn where they are used.
 *  To compile code that still uses them without the warnings, define the macro empty before the headers are included:
 *  `#define DXFG_DEPRECATED(message)` in the code, or `-DDXFG_DEPRECATED(message)=` on the command line of GCC and
 *  Clang. With MSVC, the warning is C4996 (`/wd4996` disables it).
