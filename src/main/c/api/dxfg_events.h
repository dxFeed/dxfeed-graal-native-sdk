 *
 * The `attachment` (the same for dxfg_configuration_t) is a UTF-8 null-terminated string (`const char *`, declared
 * as `void *`) or NULL when there is no attachment:
 * - Java -> C: a `String` attachment is passed as is, the other objects are passed as their string representation
 *   (`toString()`), no attachment is NULL. An attachment that Java cannot deserialize (e.g. its class is not
 *   registered for the native image) is NULL too, the SDK logs a warning then.
 * - C -> Java: the attachment becomes a `String`, NULL is no attachment.
 *
 * So a non-string attachment loses its type when it passes through C: if the event is published back
 * (or forwarded to another endpoint), the Java receivers get the string instead of the original object.
 *
 * The C API does not support arbitrary Java attachments: C can neither create nor read them. For a string payload
 * prefer dxfg_text_message_t and dxfg_text_configuration_t (TextMessage, TextConfiguration): their `text` is a plain
 * string that passes both ways without loss.
 *
 * Memory:
 * - The events that the SDK gives to the caller (to a listener, from dxfg_DXFeed_getLastEvent(), a promise, etc.)
 *   own their strings: the SDK frees them with the event (after the listener returns, or with dxfg_EventType_release()
 *   and dxfg_CList_EventType_release()). Copy the attachment to keep it longer.
 * - The events that the caller allocates itself and passes to the SDK (dxfg_DXPublisher_publishEvents(), etc.) are
 *   only read: the SDK copies the attachment during the call, the caller allocates and frees it.
 * - dxfg_EventType_release() of an event created by dxfg_EventType_new() frees its strings with the SDK's allocator.
 *   If the caller sets the attachment of such an event to its own string, it resets the attachment to NULL before
 *   the release and frees the string itself (the allocators of the caller and of the SDK may differ, e.g. on Windows).
